        <h6 class="headings">What Is SEO And Why is it Important?</h6>
        <p>
          SEO or Search Engine Optimization involves taking the necessary
          steps to ensure that your website appears early on search engine
          result pages or SERPs. When a person searches for a topic related to
          your website, then it only makes sense that your site would come up
          on search results, right? This is not necessarily true. If your site
          is not optimized for search engines, it could appear closer to the
          last page of results. And, I don’t know about you, but I never make
          it to that last page before clicking on a relevant link! In other
          words, if your site is not optimized for search engines and either
          appears very late in search results or not at all, then you will
          experience a lack of visitors to your site. For this reason, SEO is
          very important. Knowing about SEO and how to implement SEO tools
          helps drive visitors to your website, whether you use a CMS, a
          website builder like, or you create your website from scratch. This
          web page provides general information about SEO and how it can be
          implemented.
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">Search Engines</h4>
        <p>
          While a complete understanding of how search engines work is not
          required, a basic understanding can be helpful. When you type a word
          or a phrase into a search bar for Google, Yahoo Search, Bing, etc.,
          the chosen search engine then starts by sending robots to crawl the
          web for the requested information. These “crawlers”, as they are
          commonly called, start by locating a few web pages to find URLs to
          add or update in the main index of the search engine. Then they
          either add or update web pages to the search engine’s index and
          results are displayed according to relevancy. When the crawlers
          search for related information, what are they looking for? You may
          have heard the term “keyword” before in the context of SEO. In SEO,
          keywords are the words that are entered into the search bar. One
          major aspect of SEO consists of making sure that your website
          incorporates pertinent and relevant content (text, images, links,
          etc.), includes SEO friendly markup (tags are named appropriately
          and appear in the correct order on the page), and contains keywords.
          For an extensive explanation of search engine methods, read the Moz
          Beginners Guide to SEO

        <h4 class="headings">Website Evaluation & Keywords</h4>
        <p>
          Successful SEO begins with evaluating your website’s demographics.
          Who do you want to visit your site and how are they likely to search
          for it? Think about the terms you would enter to search for the
          products or services your website offers. Integrating SEO from the
          start is good practice and knowing your target audience helps with
          the process. Generating a list of keywords should also be considered
          when you begin to develop content for your site. While there are
          many paid SEO keyword tools, listed below are several free options
          that are worth evaluating. Moz Explorer Allows keyword searches -
          limits to 10 keyword searches/month Google Trends Displays
          performance levels of keywords over a selected time period Google
          Search Console Allows you to search which keywords you already have
          that are ranking with search engines. Suggestion Keyword Finder
          Outputs a list of the top ten search terms that relate to the core
          or “seed” keyword(s). Numerous online resources can point you to the
          type of SEO tool you need. For a detailed list of keyword tools and
